## Environment requirements
```
- Node v22.12.x or more
- Pnpm 9.15.x or more
```

Then, on local environment case, just cloning the repo in your local environment, and make a `.env`
file with the mandatory variables mentioned in [.env.example](/.env.example)
and described in detail in this document.

## Future Improvements
Some UX details were not covered:

- Alerts when a user attempts to delete a user.
- Notifications when a user is successfully created or edited.
- Alerts for certain validation errors.
- Improvements to function parameters, perhaps using more accurate models like DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) or similar.
- Consideration of an event-driven approach in React to avoid the dreaded coupling.
- Possibly using React Context, though I'm unsure how this application will scale.
  However, it is a good practice for maintaining best practices as the app scales and to ensure better maintainability.

All of this, and many more improvements, could be included in a future versionâ€”possibly version 1.3.0 or beyond.
